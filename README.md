# SQL Data Analysis with Azure Databricks – Learning Project

This project is based on a hands-on exercise from Microsoft Learn and represents an individual learning activity. My goal was to **learn how to perform data analysis using SQL within the Azure Databricks environment** and understand the basic concept of a data warehouse.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Azure Databricks is a powerful platform for big data analytics. In this project, I aimed to:

- Provision a Databricks Workspace in Azure,
- Start a SQL Warehouse (formerly known as SQL Endpoint),
- Use the SQL Editor to create a database and table,
- Upload a CSV file and convert it into a table,
- Query the data using SQL,
- Create a dashboard to visualize the results.

Through these steps, I built a basic analytical data structure and practiced querying and visualizing data.

## 📌 What I Learned

During this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Creating an Azure Databricks workspace via the Azure portal
- Using Azure Cloud Shell and running PowerShell scripts
- Configuring and starting a **SQL Warehouse**
- Creating a **database and table using SQL**
- Uploading a CSV file and importing it into a table
- Understanding how **Databricks File System (DBFS)** works
- Writing SQL queries for data analysis
- Creating dashboards and visualizations (bar chart)
- Publishing dashboards to share insights with others

## ⏱ Estimated Duration

Completing this project took approximately **30 minutes**. Some Azure resources required a few additional minutes to provision and configure.

## 🧹 Clean-Up and Cost Management

After finishing the project, I shut down the SQL Warehouse and deleted the resources to avoid unnecessary costs in my Azure subscription.

## 📚 Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to understand the fundamentals of SQL-based analysis in Azure. It gave me a clear, practical understanding of how data analysts and engineers work in cloud-based data environments like Azure Databricks.
